# DataCitation
In order for this framework to work a triple store supporting SRAPQL* and RDF* needs to be setup, either locally or remotely. The only two parameters that need to be configured are the GET/read and POST/write endpoint. This is done by instantiating the class DataCitation and passing the two endpoints to the constructor. Examples for a locally set up "GraphDB free" database are found in the file "Playground".
