R4 - Query uniqueness
there are some equivalent SPARQL statements, like:

*WHERE clause is optional

*"rdf:type" predicate can be replaced by "a"

*if all subjects are selected one does not need to write a variable in the form ?s but can just use an Asterisk

*if the same subject is used multiple times in subsequent triplets separated by a dot it can be simplified by writing just the first subject variable name, separating the triplets by semicolons and leaving out the other variable names that are equal to the one in the first triple

*aliases via BIND keyword will just rename variables but the query result will stay the same
 
*variable names in general can differ between two queries without changing the semantics.

*Finding variables that are not bound can be written in two ways
** with optional keyword adding the optional triplet combined with filter condition !bound(?var)
** with "filter not exists (triplet)"

*inverting the order of the triplet (object predicate subject instead of subject predicate object) using "^" gives the same results

*sequence paths can reduce the number of triplets in the query statement and are commonly used.
